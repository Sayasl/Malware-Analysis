# Dynamic Malware analysis

This project leverages a variety of advanced tools for malware analysis within the Flare VM environment. Four Key Aspects to Consider:

### Process Activity
* Process Hacker
* Procmon
### Traffic Analysis: Research network activity as malware steals data and send it to hacker
* Wireshark (Filter: smtp, http, DNS)
### Registry Activities
* Regshot (Keys added, deleted, value added, modified & false added)
* Procmon
Keys to research:
	HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
	HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
	HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
	HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
### File Activities
* Regshot
* Procmon
* Output: "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\"
### Additional activities
Win+R= Run
	(%Temp%, shell:startup, shell:common startup)
- Task Scheduler -> Triggers & Actions
- Task Manager
### Results:
	Firstly, in Task Scheduler, a file named 'updater.exe' was triggered at logon with its status enabled, and the action was set to start a program.

	Secondly, using Regshot, a comparison between the initial and subsequent shots revealed significant registry changes, including keys being deleted, added, values modified, and the presence of a suspicious key.
