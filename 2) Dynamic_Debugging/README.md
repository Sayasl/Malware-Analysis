# Dynamic Malware Analysis: Debugging

This project harnesses the power of two advanced tools for debugging and malware analysis within the robust Flare VM environment.

### Process Activity
* x32dbg
* APIMonitor

### Result:

A malicious file was executed and debugged using x32dbg, where the breakdown revealed instructions leading to the creation of libraries, API calls, and their subsequent destruction. The binary was then modified with NOPs for further debugging. A patched file was created and analyzed with APIMonitor.

Finally, the patched file was opened in APIMonitor to monitor API calls, checking for any evasion techniques.
