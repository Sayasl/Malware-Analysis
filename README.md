# Malware Analysis Projects

This repository highlights comprehensive static and dynamic analysis of malicious files using a diverse array of tools in Flare-VM. It features detailed screenshots that vividly demonstrate the processes, tools, and results involved in each analysis.

## Analysis
1. [Static Analysis](https://github.com/Sayasl/Malware-Analysis/tree/main/Static): A diverse set of tools was utilized for static analysis. The process encompassed identifying file types, hashing the malware and checking it on VirusTotal, uncovering and decrypting strings, and determining if the file was packed.
2. [Dynamic Analysis](https://shorturl.at/oPXw4): The analysis include process monitoring with Process Hacker and Procmon, network traffic analysis using Wireshark, and registry and file activity tracking with Regshot. Notable findings revealed a scheduled task for 'updater.exe' and significant registry modifications.
3. [Dynamic Analysis: Debugging](https://shorturl.at/QwyXh): This project utilizes x32dbg and APIMonitor for advanced debugging and malware analysis within the Flare VM environment. A malicious file was debugged to reveal its API call activities, then modified and further analyzed to check for evasion techniques. Key findings included instructions for creating and destroying libraries and API calls.
